## User Interface I

![Great Idea! Website](/assets/images/23-07-18/user-interface-i.png "Great Idea! Website screenshot")

The first week of Lambda School explored the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This project incorporated:
- semantic HTML tags
- CSS selectors
- CSS specificity and inheritance

The concepts this week werenâ€™t novel to me but Iâ€™ve never been tasked with creating a pixel perfect rendition of a website from a mockup. The project was challenging but I really enjoyed the process.

The site is hosted on Netlify [here](https://user-interface-i.netlify.com/).
