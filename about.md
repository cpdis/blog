I'm Colin Dismuke and this is my site. Ostensibly it is a repository for experiments in machine learning and other projects but will likely extend to the far reaches of the Internet and beyond.

I'm an ocean engineer currently living in Houston, TX. You can find me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cpdis), [on Github](http://github.com/cpdis), [on AngeList](https://angel.co/colin-dismuke), and [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cpdis/). 

I joined [Delmar Systems](http://www.delmarsystems.com/site.php) in 2012 as a member of the technical and engineering team. I've done a lot of engineering work and traveled all over the world designing and deploying mooring systems.

Before that, I spent six years at [Texas A&M](https://engineering.tamu.edu/ocean/) getting a few degrees.

Want to chat? Feel free to [email me](mailto:colin.dismuke@gmail.com).
