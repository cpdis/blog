I'm Colin Dismuke and this is my site. I'm fascinated with how to make computers smarter. We live in incredibly exciting times with huge increases in data and computational resources. How can we harness these advances to make the world a better place? I hope to document my journey toward achieving that goal here.

I'm an ocean engineer currently living in Houston, TX. You can find me [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/cpdis), [on Github](http://github.com/cpdis), [on AngelList](https://angel.co/colin-dismuke), and [on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cpdis/). 

I joined [Delmar Systems](http://www.delmarsystems.com/site.php) in 2012 as a member of the technical and engineering team. I've done a lot of engineering work and traveled all over the world designing and deploying mooring systems.

Before that, I spent six years at [Texas A&M](https://engineering.tamu.edu/ocean/) getting a few degrees.
